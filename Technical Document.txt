The Nim Game

The recent major updates for this game are "New Game" button which can start a new game at any point in 
the game by remembering the selected player in the begining 
and again starting with him and also remembering the strategy set by the computer player.
And the next major update is the computer player do not need any human interaction to take turn.

The New Game option is set in the Game menu as it felt appropriate for me.
There is a new random button which is used to select the player randomly at the start of the game.

I've edited most of my code in View and made minor changes to Model classes.
