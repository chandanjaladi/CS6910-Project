        <h1>History</h1>
        <p>
            Variants of Nim have been played since ancient times. The game is said to have originated in China—it
            closely resembles the Chinese game of 捡石子 jiǎn-shízi, or "picking stones"—but the origin is uncertain;
            the earliest European references to Nim are from the beginning of the 16th century. Its current name was
            coined by Charles L. Bouton of Harvard University, who also developed the complete theory of the game in
            1901, but the origins of the name were never fully explained. The Oxford English Dictionary derives
            the name from the German verb nimm meaning take!<br><br>
            At the 1940 New York World's Fair Westinghouse displayed a machine, the Nimatron, that played Nim. From
            May 11, 1940, to October 27, 1940, only a few people were able to beat the machine in that six-month
            period;
            if they did, they were presented with a coin that said Nim Champ. It was also one of the first-ever
            electronic computerized games. Ferranti built a Nim playing computer which was displayed at the Festival
            of
            Britain in 1951.<br><br> In 1952 Herbert Koppel, Eugene Grant and Howard Bailer, engineers from the W. L.
            Maxon
            Corporation, developed a machine weighing 23 kilograms (50 lb) which played Nim against a human opponent
            and
            regularly won. A Nim Playing Machine has been described made from TinkerToy.

        <h2>What is NIM?</h2>
        <p>
            Nim is a mathematical game of strategy in which two players take turns removing (or "nimming") objects
            from
            distinct heaps or piles. On each turn, a player must remove at least one object, and may remove any
            number
            of objects provided they all come from the same heap or pile. Depending on the version being played, the
            goal of the game is either to avoid taking the last object or to take the last object.

                    <h2>The subtraction game</h2>
                    <p>
                        In another game which is commonly known as Nim (but is better called the subtraction game),
                        an
                        upper bound is imposed on the number of objects that can be removed in a turn. Instead of
                        removing arbitrarily many objects, a player can only remove 1 or 2 or ... or k at a time.
                        This
                        game is commonly played in practice with only one heap.

                        Bouton's analysis carries over easily to the general multiple-heap version of this game. The
                        only difference is that as a first step, before computing the Nim-sums we must reduce the
                        sizes
                        of the heaps modulo k + 1. If this makes all the heaps of size zero (in misère play),
                        the
                        winning move is to take k objects from one of the heaps. In particular, in ideal play from a
                        single heap of n objects, the second player can win if and only if

                        0 = n (mod k + 1) (in normal play), or
                        1 = n (mod k + 1) (in misère play).
                        This follows from calculating the nim-sequence of S(1,2,...,k),

                        0.123…k0123…k0123⋯ = 0.123…k,

                        from which the strategy above follows by the Sprague-Grundy theorem.

                    <h2>The 21 game</h2>
                    <p>
                        The game "21" is played as a misère game with any number of players who take turns saying a
                        number. The first player says "1" and each player in turn increases the number by 1, 2, or
                        3,
                        but may not exceed 21; the player forced to say "21" loses. This can be modeled as a
                        subtraction
                        game with a heap of 21–n objects. The winning strategy for the two-player version of this
                        game
                        is to always say a multiple of 4; it is then guaranteed that the other player will
                        ultimately
                        have to say 21; so in the standard version, wherein the first player opens with "1", they
                        start
                        with a losing move.

                        The 21 game can also be played with different numbers, e.g., "Add at most 5; lose on 34".

                    <h2>The 100 game</h2>
                    <p>
                        A similar version is the "100 game": Two players start from 0 and alternately add a number from
                        1 to 10 to the sum. The player who reaches 100 wins. The winning strategy is to reach a
                        number
                        in which the digits are subsequent (e.g., 01, 12, 23, 34,...) and control the game by
                        jumping
                        through all the numbers of this sequence. Once a player reaches 89, the opponent can only
                        choose
                        numbers from 90 to 99, and the next answer can in any case be 100.

                    <p>
                        In another variation of Nim, besides removing any number of objects from a single heap,
                        one is permitted to remove the same number of objects from each heap.

                    <p>
                        Yet another variation of Nim is 'Circular Nim', where in any number of objects are placed in
                        a
                        circle and two players alternately remove one, two or three adjacent objects.

                    <h2>Grundy's game</h2>
                    <p>
                        In Grundy's game, another variation of Nim, a number of objects are placed in an initial
                        heap
                        and two players alternately divide a heap into two nonempty heaps of different sizes. Thus,
                        six
                        objects may be divided into piles of 5+1 or 4+2, but not 3+3. Grundy's game can be played as
                        either misère or normal play.

                    <h2>Greedy Nim</h2>
                    <p>
                        Greedy Nim is a variation wherein the players are restricted to choosing stones from only the
                        largest pile. It is a finite impartial game. Greedy Nim Misère has the same rules as Greedy
                        Nim, but here the last player able to make a move loses.

                        Let the largest number of stones in a pile be m and the second largest number of stones in a
                        pile be n. Let pm be the number of piles having m stones and pn be the number of piles
                        having n
                        stones. Then there is a theorem that game positions with pm even are P positions. This
                        theorem can be shown by considering the positions where pm is odd. If pm is larger than 1,
                        all
                        stones may be removed from this pile to reduce pm by 1 and the new pm will be even. If pm =
                        1
                        (i.e. the largest heap is unique), there are two cases:

                        If pn is odd, the size of the largest heap is reduced to n (so now the new pm is even).
                        If pn is even, the largest heap is removed entirely, leaving an even number of largest
                        heaps.
                        Thus, there exists a move to a state where pm is even. Conversely, if pm is even, if any
                        move is
                        possible (pm ≠ 0), then it must take the game to a state where pm is odd. The final position
                        of
                        the game is even (pm = 0). Hence, each position of the game with pm even must be a P
                        position.

                    <h2>Index-k Nim</h2>
                    <p>
                        A generalization of multi-heap Nim was called "Nimk" or "index-k" Nim by E. H. Moore,[13] who
                        analyzed it in 1910. In index-k Nim, instead of
                        removing objects from only one heap, players can remove objects from at least one but up to
                        k
                        different heaps. The number of elements that may be removed from each heap may be either
                        arbitrary or limited to at most r elements, like in the "subtraction game" above.

                        The winning strategy is as follows: Like in ordinary multi-heap Nim, one considers the
                        binary
                        representation of the heap sizes (or heap sizes modulo r + 1). In ordinary Nim one forms the
                        XOR-sum (or sum modulo 2) of each binary digit, and the winning strategy is to make each XOR
                        sum
                        zero. In the generalization to index-k Nim, one forms the sum of each binary digit modulo k
                        + 1.

                        Again the winning strategy is to move such that this sum is zero for every digit. Indeed,
                        the
                        value thus computed is zero for the final position, and given a configuration of heaps for
                        which
                        this value is zero, any change of at most k heaps will make the value non-zero.
                        Conversely,
                        given a configuration with non-zero value, one can always take from at most k heaps,
                        carefully
                        chosen, so that the value will become zero.

                        Building Nim is a variant of Nim wherein the two players first construct the game of Nim.
                        Given
                        n stones and s empty piles, the players, alternating turns, place exactly one stone into a
                        pile
                        of their choice.[14] Once all the stones are placed, a game of Nim begins, starting with the
                        next player that would move. This game is denoted BN(n,s).
